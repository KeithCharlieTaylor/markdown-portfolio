# Keith Taylor's Markdown Profile
Welcome to the start of my Markdown Profile. As directed by GitHub's *Communicating using Markdown* course.

I'll extend this during the course. Then I might continue to develop this profile. If it forms a useful part of my GitHub story.

## Your Markdown Profile
If you'd like to create your own Markdown Profile on GitHub, join the course I mentioned above. The URL is https://lab.github.com/githubtraining/communicating-using-markdown. Later, I expect to learn how to use markdown to generate a fully formed link with anchor text.
